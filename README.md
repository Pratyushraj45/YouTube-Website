# YouTube Clone Single Page Application with React, Tailwind CSS, and Rapid API

## Project Description

This project involves the creation of a fully functional and responsive YouTube clone single-page application using React JS, Tailwind CSS, and the Rapid API. Through the project, I had explored essential React JS concepts such as JSX, components, props, state, lifecycle of components, conditional rendering, lists, keys, and the Context API. Additionally, I implemented intricate JavaScript logics to enhance the interactivity and visual appeal of the React application.
